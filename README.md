## Guide

### How to Install and Run

#### Step 1: Prerequisites
- Install **pnpm** (recommended):  
  ```shell
  npm install -g pnpm
  ```

#### Step 2: Set Up the Repository
1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```
2. Install dependencies using **pnpm**:
   ```shell
   pnpm install
   ```

#### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
2. Add the following variables:
   ```env
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<your_nextauth_secret>
   MONGODB_URL=<your_mongodb_url>
   ```

#### Step 4: Prepare the Database
Ensure your MongoDB instance contains a database named **Japanese** with the following collections:
- `kana_vocabulary`
- `vocabulary`
- `kanji`
- `radical`

Each document in the collections should follow this format:

```json
{
  "id": number,
  "data": {
    "level": number,
    "slug": string,
    "characters": string,
    "meanings": [
      {
        "meaning": string,
        "primary": bool,
        "accepted_answer": bool
      }
    ],
    "readings": [
      {
        "type": string,
        "primary": bool,
        "reading": string,
        "accepted_answer": bool
      }
    ],
    "component_subject_ids": [int],
    "amalgamation_subject_ids": [int],
    "visually_similar_subject_ids": [int],
    "meaning_mnemonic": string,
    "reading_mnemonic": string,
    "lesson_position": number
  }
}
```

#### Step 5: Run the Application for Development
